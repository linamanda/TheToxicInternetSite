        It's the users who make up the internet community and therefore it's the users who must all make an effort to reduce toxicity on the internet. Remember: people are people, whether they're right next to you or on the other side of the Earth. That being said, how can you play a role in reducing internet toxicity?

      <ol class="sub-Content">
        <li>Make the connection between real life and online life: Is that something you would say to someone if you were to see them in person face-to-face?</li>
        <li>Mind your manners: Is that something approate to say? What would your parents thing? What about others?</li>
        <li>Keep an open mind: Maybe the person you're talking to isn't having a good day. Don't make it worse and say triggering things.</li>
        <li>Stay chill: Refrain from bad-mouthing the bad-mouther. You'll then be a bad-mouther yourself!</li>

        Players often rationalize such toxicity as a normal part of gaming. But, as new research shows, this behavior has significant, long-term negative effects on players, especially those who do not fall into the stereotypical gamer demographic of young white males. Despite studies suggesting that women are equally or more skilled than men in video games when given the same amount of playing time, they are more likely than their male counterparts to be targets of toxicity. And studies suggest toxicity is more harmful to women, not only with respect to psychological well-being but also because certain coping mechanisms—like not using voice chat, to hide gender—puts women at a disadvantage within the game itself. Such experiences discourage women and girls from playing, which means they are less likely to gain the cognitive benefits of gaming such as spatial rotation skills, which are associated with success in technological career paths—an area in which there is already rampant gender disparity. Studies also suggest that exposure to gender stereotypes within games potentially causes negative attitudes about women in other stereotyped domains, such as STEM fields.

        Although research tends to focus on gendered toxicity, minority groups are also frequently victimized. According to a recent survey from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) of 1,000 US gamers ages 18 to 45, more than half of multiplayer gamers reported harassment related to their race/ethnicity, religion, ability, gender, or sexual orientation in the previous six months. This study also found that roughly a third of LGBTQ, Black, and Hispanic/Latinx players experienced in-game harassment related to their sexual orientation, race, or ethnicity. And 81 percent of multiplayer gamers overall experience some form of harassment, the majority of whom also reported experiencing physical threats, stalking, and sexual harassment. Further, 64 percent of respondents felt that toxicity impacted them, with 11 percent reporting depressive or suicidal thoughts, and nearly a quarter saying they had quit playing certain games as a result of these negative experiences.
